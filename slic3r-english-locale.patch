Upstream constantly refuses to support Perl >= 5.16.
They say it handles locales incorrectly, but it might be caused by bad code
design. Running Slic3r with locales using other char than point as a decimal
separator causes crashes. This patch removes the warning about unsupported
Perl version (it is very annoying) and forces Slic3r to use English decimal
separator by setting the LC_NUMERIC environment variable. Setting it in more
Perl way doesn't work and is overwritten in some of imported modules.
